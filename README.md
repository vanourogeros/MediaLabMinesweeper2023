# MediaLabMinesweeper2023


This is a slight variation of the famous Minesweeper game in Java using JavaFX - a Project for ECE NTUA 7th Semester Course "Multimedia Technology", and also my first ever project in Java.
In this game a "superbomb" is introduced: A mine that reveals all the tiles in the same row and column if it is marked correctly in the first 4 tries (only in hard mode).

In this app a user can generate (Application>Create) and use (Application>Load, then Application>Start) a scenario that contains the difficulty level, number of bombs, and time limit. That scenario description is saved in the "multimedia" folder.

Effect of correctly marking a Superbomb:
